# OpenGlPractice Repo - Pages

This little repository should document the process of learning OpenGL with GLFW (C++). The result of this learning process will be a tiny api for drawing scenes to a window with less effort.
The implementation of a new feature is outsourced to a new branch, which is merged with the main branch after the implementation was completed.

As a demo, a little terrain can be generated: <br>
